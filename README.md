Operating systems with Dr. Karlsson

# Exam 1 - A Diagnostic Shell

This is a shell called `dash` that is used for system process diagnostic and experimentation.
The shell is executed using the `./dash` command after which you can do your usual day to day shell operations at the `dash> ` prompt. Certain system process info is printed before and after issuing commands for your understanding benefit. 

## Algorithms/Libraries

I decided to use C++ so I could have access to more modern lanuage features.

For command parsing, I used the C++ string class and a string stream for tokenization.

I used standard system calls for all other operations to keep dependencies to a minimum.

## Functions/Program Structure

### main.cpp

This file contains the main loop, user input, various helpful constants, and a function useful for splitting a string into its tokens.

### dash.cpp

The main bread and butter of the program, this contains a class `Dash` that contains two functions.

`run(vector<string> tokens)` - this commmand accepts tokenized input from `main.cpp`, and runs the command. It verifies if the command is unique to `dash`, in which case it runs the desired commands for desired output, or if it is a general system command. It could use some cleanup, perhaps another day... ðŸ™ƒ

`getInfo(string value)` - this is a PRIVATE function that runs informational commands how all my commands should have been run but I wasn't smart enough/was too lazy until the end of writing the program. Essentially takes in a destination and cats it to the output stream. This is used for getting cpuinfo, meminfo, kernel version, and uptime. 

### makefile

Just your good old, classic makefile that got made, scaled to really cool modular structure, didn't work, messed with it for a day or two, didn't get anywhere, and converted back to just your regular good ol' classic makefile again. [Tradition!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRdfX7ut8gw)

## Compilation/Usage

#### Build

As stated above, the good ol' regular make file should build the whole thing just fine with:

`make`

and should clean the whole thing just fine with:

`make clean`

I'm not a C++/make wizard on purpose cause I have better things to do with my time so that's as complicated as that build system gets.

#### Usage

To start the program, build and then run `./dash`.

There are a couple of custom commands for your own personal benefit/enjoyment. Here are their details:

```cmdnm <process_id>``` - prints the command used to initiate the process_id from the arguments

```pid <command>``` - prints the process id or ids associated with a command name, supplied from the arguments

```systat``` - prints various interesting system stat stuff

Everything else about the shell should work similar to what you're familiar to, minus all the good parts that make shell like ZSH such a pleasure to use.

## Testing

This was tested by running a bunch of commands against it during development as well as general 'poking around' on the following systems:

- Raspbian Linux on Pi 2
- Ubuntu 20.10 on my home server
- MacOS Big Sur
- Lubuntu 20.04 in VM
- Ubuntu 20.04 on Windows Subsystem for Linux

Various levels of functionality were supported in each environment. Here's a summary:

- getrusage() was suspect in all of the environments but worked best in MacOS (other systems struggled to give me system time)
- Windows Subsystem for Linux did all the normal shell stuff fine but the custom commands didn't work as you don't have access to the same file structure at root
- Raspbian and native ubuntus did well, supporting most things pretty well. Did notice that the arm processor reports `cpuinfo` in a much more verbose manner than the Intel x86 procs do
- There is a bug (?) that happens sometimes where you enter in a command and it pretends like it runs but then locks the whole shell from executing any more commands, even though input is still accepted. I wasn't able to trace down a definite cause so it's just gonna be a known thing that happens. A quick `ctrl-c` and `./dash` will fix the problem. Not ideal, but what can you do. ðŸ¤·
